    <div class="initial-draft">
      The initial keeper draft will be held this December and will be a full 15-rounds long. All players will be eligible to be drafted.
    </div>
    
    <div class="first-signing">
      For the 2020-21 season the first signing period will begin after roughly 40% of the season has been completed and last for 1.5-2 weeks. 
      Salaries for every player in the league will be posted on the first day of the signing period.
      Contracts can be signed at any point during the signing period by sending a message to either the group or the commissioner with the player's name and length of the contract.
      Once a contract is signed, the player's salary is locked in for the length of the contract.
    </div>
    
    <div class="second-signing">
      At the end of the 2021 GSHL Finals, the second signing period will begin and last for roughly 3-4 weeks.
      New salaries for every player will be posted on the first day of the signing period.
    </div>
    
    <div class="free-agency">
      At the end of the second signing period every player that does not have a GSHL contract becomes a UFA.
      New salaries will be posted for all available UFAs that are equal to 125% of their end of season salary.
      Team's can enter a contract bid for a UFA at any time during the off-season the same way you would announce a normal contract.
      Bids will be processed weekly, if there are multiple bids for the same player that week a lottery will be held using the coming draft lottery odds to decide which team will get the player.
      Signing a UFA, through a lottery or not, will result in a slight loss of draft lottery ping-pong balls.
    </div>

    <div class="future-initial-draft">
      The draft pool will be made up of all un-signed UFAs on the day of the draft.
      The draft will be reduced to 12 rounds.
      All teams without 3 contract players must fill empty roster spots with UDFAs.
      All players under contract will have a year come off their contract length once rosters are set for the year at the end of the draft.
      Players with only the current season left on their contract will come of the cap table early and open up their contract slot for the early signing period.
      These players will also be given an RFA designation for the remainder of the season.
    </div>
    
    <div class="future-first-signing">
      Salaries will be posted on December 15th and the early signing period will last until New Year's Eve.
      Players with an RFA designation can be resigned to a second contract by their team at 115% of their actual salary (factored in to posted salary).
      Teams with open contract slots can sign players to contracts.
    </div>
    
    <div class="future-second-signing">
      Salaries will be posted at the end of the GSHL Finals and the signing period will last the end of the NHL playoffs.

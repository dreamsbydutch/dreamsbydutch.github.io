                This matchup isn't as intriguing as it looked just a few weeks ago. The president's trophy winning Peps is taking one of the best rosters we've ever seen in to this year's playoffs, Auston Matthews, Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, David Patrnak, the star power is endless. While The Waupoos Flash are playing without Evgeni Malkin, Teuvo Teravainen, and Filip Forsberg, and they entered the final week of the regular season 1-3 in their last 4 games. It seems like Peps dodged a bullet here and should move on but Peps has had star power before, they just won their second president's trophy in the last three years, yet they still have never made a finals appearance and are just 1-3 in the playoffs as the higher seed, 2-4 overall. Couple that with the fact that The Waupoos Flash is coming off a trip to BlazerDri where they put together the best performance of the week, winning a very tough regular season finale, and there could be some legit upset potential here. The question is, did The Waupoos Flash just get lucky last week or do they really have a chance to get the upset win they nearly had 5 weeks ago when they came to Peps Arena and left with a 5-5 loss.

                Dirty F & Gs are hot, or more specifically Nathan MacKinnon is hot. At 3-4 the playoffs seemed like a pipe dream for Dirty F & Gs but Nathan MacKinnon has put this team on his back and has this extremly mediocre roster buzzing, even Jared fucking McCann is playing well right now. They are 5-1 in their last 6 games and that includes a 5-4 victory in this very same building a month ago. That being said, the Auto Draft All-Stars are still the defending champions and have the only roster on the Sunview side of the bracket that could compete in an extended final against the Hickory Hotel. MacKinnon vs Draisaitl and Tkachuk vs Tkachuk are two intriguing matchups in this one but beyond that it becomes very obvious that Dirty F & Gs can't compete with the star power of the All-Stars. Dirty F & Gs seemingly has no answer for guys like Scheifele, Bergeron, and Hamilton and the All-Stars will likely extend their playoff winning streak to 4.

                The marquee matchup of the first round is going to be an absolute war. Both of these franchises are making just their second GSHL playoff run and both made it all the way to the finals in their lone playoff appearance. Hubie's Beauties won the title in 2018 and now their undefeated playoff record is on the line as they go on the road to face the 2019 finalists, BlazerDri, who dominated the lone regular season matchup between these two but week 5 feels like ages ago. This time, BlazerDri may have a slight edge in goaltending with Vasilevskiy, Hubie's Beauties may have a slight edge in physicality with Wheeler and Benn, and BlazerDri may have a very slight edge in scoring with Marchand and Guentzel but all those margins are as razor thin as it gets. Both these franchises have gone all in for this 2021 cup run and one of these franchises is going to walk away with a painful round one exit. This one is going to be fun.

                They were buyers, then sellers, then buyers again, the Nose Beers have had an interesting season to say the least but in a very weak Sunview conference they actually have a chance at a playoff win or two. The Nose Beers roster looks like a bottom feeder compared to the teams on the Hickory side of the bracket but they just keep finding ways to win week in and week out and are entering the playoffs with 3 wins in their last 4 games. On the other hand, Robert Thomas looked like they had the number one seed all locked up just a few weeks ago but are now in the midst of a free fall that could derail their first playoff run before it even starts. There's no question that Robert Thomas is the more talented team here on paper but the way the last month has gone, there is a very real chance that Robert Thomas gets upset in their first ever home playoff game.

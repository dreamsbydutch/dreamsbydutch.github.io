    <div class="rulebook-subheader">Rosters</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">The field for each tournament will be split into five groups that will be finalized on
        the Monday morning prior to each tournament. Groups will be chosen based on the <a href="ratings.html">PGC
            Rating</a>.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">Each member chooses 2 golfers from each of the 5 groupings to create your 10 golfer team
        for the tournament. You will make new picks and have a new team for each tournament on the schedule.</div>

    <div class="rulebook-subheader">Scoring</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">During Rounds 1 and 2 of the tournament your team’s score will be the average strokes of
        all 10 golfers on your team.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">Rounds 3 and 4 of the tournament your team’s score will be the average
        strokes of the 5 lowest golfers on your team that day.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">The leaderboard will look just like a PGA leaderboard and
        tracked live on the Live Leaderboard page.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-subrules">Teams must have 5 golfers make the weekend cut line or their team will be cut from
        the PGC tournament. Any golfers that withdraw before cut day will receive a score of 8-over par until cut day.

    <div class="rulebook-subheader">Playoffs</div>

    <div class="rulebook-subrules">Winners of bottom tier tournaments will win 450 points.</div>

    <div class="rulebook-rules">At the end of the season the top 30 teams in the standings will make the PGC Playoff
        tournament.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-subrules">Each team will start the playoff tournament under par based on the distribution
        below.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">The playoff tournament will be 12-rounds long throughout all three FedEx Cup Playoff
        events (Northern Trust, BMW Championship, TOUR Championship). Members that qualify for the playoff tournament
        will pick their team prior to the Northern Trust as usual and this will be your team of golfers through the
        entire playoffs.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-subrules">The Northern Trust will run just like a normal tournament.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-subrules">The BMW Championship will only count your top 5 golfers in all 4 rounds.</div>
    <div class="rulebook-subrules">The TOUR Championship will only count your top 3 golfers in all 4 rounds.</div>

    <div class="rulebook-subheader">Payouts</div>
    <div class="rulebook-rules">After every tournament the top 20-25 finishers will win money earnings. Earnings will
        accumulate during the season and will be paid out at the end of the year.</div>

        1st to $1.50 for 20th.</div>
